# Adding or Modifying a Managed Form

This file owns the **rules**, not the MCP sequence. The pre-edit and post-edit MCP playbooks live in:

- `tooling-playbooks.md → Form Analysis and Generation` — full ordered list of MCP calls (`search_forms` → `inspect_form_layout` → `metadatasearch` → `get_xsd_schema` → write/modify XML → `verify_xml` → compile via the `1c-metadata-manage` skill).

Do not duplicate that sequence here.

## Rules specific to creating / modifying a form

- **Prefer the `1c-metadata-manage` skill** (form-manage section) over hand-edited XML for non-trivial form changes. Hand-editing is acceptable only for small tweaks fully covered by the XSD; for anything else, the skill drives the toolchain (BOM, encoding, UID generation, ordering of `ChildObjects`).
- **XSD validation is mandatory** after any XML edit — `verify_xml` against the schema returned by `get_xsd_schema(object_type="Форма")`. A form that parses in your editor is not a form that loads in Designer.
- **Form-element naming.** Elements added to a typical form must carry the `{PREFIX}` prefix from `.dev.env`. Elements inside a newly created form (object already prefixed) do **not** repeat the prefix on every element — see `dev-standards-core.md §4`.
- **Common pitfalls** are catalogued in `metadata-xml-workarounds.md` — read it before hand-editing the XML.
- **Region structure of the form module** — `module-structure.md → Form Module` (5 mandatory regions).
- **Form-presentation rules** (programmatic typical-form modification, element placement, fill checking, form commands) — `dev-standards-forms.md`.

## Companion rules

| If the change also includes… | Also load |
|---|---|
| Event handlers (`ПриОткрытии`, `ПередЗаписью`, …) | `forms-events-add.md` |
| Server-side form-module code | `form-reserved-names.md` |
| Client-side async code (`Асинх` / `Ждать`) | `async-methods.md` |
| Editing the existing form module logic | `form-module.md` |

This list is curated by the router file `forms.md`; load only the items you actually touch.
